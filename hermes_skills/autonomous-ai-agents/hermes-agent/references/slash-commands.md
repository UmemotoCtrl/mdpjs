# Slash Commands (In-Session)

Registry of record: `hermes_cli/commands.py` (`COMMAND_REGISTRY`) — every
consumer (autocomplete, `/help`, Telegram menu, Slack mapping) derives from
it. New commands land often; `/help` in-session is always authoritative.
(CLI) = interactive CLI/TUI only. (GW) = gateway platforms only.
